# Fifa-Overall-Prediction
This project aims to predict FIFA video game player overall ratings using real-life football data. It leverages various machine learning algorithms to establish a correlation between in-game ratings and actual football performance metrics.

Data
The dataset, fifa.csv, contains player attributes including position, age, height, league rank, market value, team FIFA points, playing minutes, assists, goals, yellow cards, win ratio, and more.

Libraries Used
Pandas for data handling.
Scikit-learn for machine learning model implementation.
XGBoost for advanced modeling.
Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization.
Models
Linear Regression
Ridge Regression
Random Forest Regressor
XGBoost Regressor
Features
Player position, age, height, etc.
Team performance indicators.
Individual player statistics (goals, assists, minutes played, etc.).
Objective
To accurately predict FIFA overall ratings based on measurable on-field performance.
